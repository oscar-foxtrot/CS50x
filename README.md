# CS50x 2023

The solutions may contain the cs50.h header file and the corresponding functions and types which are not a part of the standard library.
These should work fine in the CS50's cloud-based version of VSCode at https://code.cs50.io/
Also the library could be downloaded at https://github.com/cs50/libcs50
