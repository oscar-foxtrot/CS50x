Course offered by Harvard University on edX platform  

## This repo includes:
* Solutions to problem sets
* Labs solutions
* Some practice problems solutions

The solutions may contain the cs50.h header file and the corresponding functions and types which are not a part of the standard library.
These should work fine in the CS50's cloud-based version of VSCode at https://code.cs50.io/
In any case the library could be downloaded at https://github.com/cs50/libcs50  

<h4>NOTE:</h4> Week 0 to week 6 tasks are taken from CS50 **2023** <br>
However, weeks 7 (included) and beyond are related to CS50 **2024**
